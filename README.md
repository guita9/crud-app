# FastAPI CRUD Application with PostgreSQL and Dev Containers

This project demonstrates a simple yet robust setup for a web application built with **FastAPI** (a Python web framework), a **PostgreSQL** database, and a smooth development experience using **VS Code Dev Containers**. It includes basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing user data.

## üöÄ Project Overview

A simple web API to manage user information (name, age, email), built with:

- **FastAPI** ‚Äì Modern Python framework for APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Reliable and scalable relational DB.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì Ensures consistent environments.
- **VS Code Dev Containers** ‚Äì Seamless development with zero manual setup.

The goal: a production-ready setup that‚Äôs easy to develop and deploy.

## ü§î Why This Setup? (Thought Process)

### Choosing Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Fast, type-safe, async-ready, auto-generates docs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Feature-rich and reliable database.

### Ensuring Consistency (Dev Containers & Docker)

To eliminate ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù problems:

- **Docker**: Packages everything into an image.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages app + db containers together.
- **VS Code Dev Containers**: Provides a preconfigured environment for all team members.

### Making it Easy to Start

- `postCreateCommand`: Installs Python dependencies automatically.
- `forwardPorts`: Forwards port `8000` so app is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Database Management

- PostgreSQL runs as a separate service.
- Uses environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`) for clean configuration.
- Includes DB health checks & persistent volumes.
