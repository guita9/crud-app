# FastAPI CRUD Application with PostgreSQL and Dev Containers

This project demonstrates a simple yet robust setup for a web application built with **FastAPI** (a Python web framework), a **PostgreSQL** database, and a smooth development experience using **VS Code Dev Containers**. It includes basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing user data.

## üöÄ Project Overview

A simple web API to manage user information (name, age, email), built with:

- **FastAPI** ‚Äì Modern Python framework for APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Reliable and scalable relational DB.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì Ensures consistent environments.
- **VS Code Dev Containers** ‚Äì Seamless development with zero manual setup.

The goal: a production-ready setup that‚Äôs easy to develop and deploy.

## ü§î Why This Setup? (Thought Process)

### Choosing Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Fast, type-safe, async-ready, auto-generates docs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Feature-rich and reliable database.

### Ensuring Consistency (Dev Containers & Docker)

To eliminate ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù problems:

- **Docker**: Packages everything into an image.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages app + db containers together.
- **VS Code Dev Containers**:  leverages Docker Compose. Instead of installing Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL directly on your computer, VS Code connects into a running Docker container (our app service). This means your local machine only needs Docker and VS Code ‚Äì everything else is managed inside the container. This eliminates setup headaches and ensures that what works in development will work when deployed.

### Making it Easy to Start

- `postCreateCommand`: In devcontainer.json file, to make the developer's life even easier, I added  "postCreateCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt". This command automatically runs inside the development container the first time it's created. This means you don't even have to manually install Python packages; the environment is ready to code as soon as you open the project in VS Code.
- `forwardPorts`: Forwards port `8000` from the dev container to our local machine so app is available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Database Management

- PostgreSQL runs as a separate service or container.
- Uses environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`) for clean configuration.
- Includes DB health checks & persistent volumes.
